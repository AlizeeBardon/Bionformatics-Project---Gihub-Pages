  I am a master student in Bioinformatics from the University of Rouen (France), and I am an apprentice at Ifremer (France). \
  
  I have worked on many aspects of bioinformatic web development and omics data management. \
  
  Eager to take on new challenges, I am currently looking for a new experience in the fields of web
  development in bioinformatics. \

          Ifremer's Genome Catalog platform provides access to the omics resources üß¨ of model marine organisms studied at Ifremer. \
          Genomes Catalog is an interactive web application that organizes entries through their metadata (taxonomy, assembly quality) and 
          give access to a Genome Browser [JBrowse2](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/) to visualise the omics data of each species. \
          The new data addition is automated thanks to the [omics-catalog workflow](https://github.com/ifremer-bioinformatics/omics-catalog). \
          My work was the enhence the original pipeline with new features (adding multiple tracks, data management, verification steps). In addition to the public catalog, I have set up a private instance for viewing unpublished data on which teams are collaborating.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
