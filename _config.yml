about_content:  # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs:w
  I am a master student in Bioinformatics from the University of Rouen (France), and I am an apprentice at Ifremer (France).
  This formation gave me the opportunity to work on different aspects of computational biology, like programming (bash, python), statistics (R),
  web development (Django, RShiny), databases (SQL, NoSQL).
  During my apprenticeship at Ifremer, I have worked on many aspects of bioinformatic web development and omics data management.
  Passionate about nature and ecology, I also hold a Master of Systematic, Evolution and Paleontology,
  from the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris,France. 
 
 
  Eager to take on new challenges, I am looking for a new experience starting in february 2023 that would combines the fields I love; ecology and bioinformatics \

          Find here genomes and omics data for marine organisms studied at Ifremer! 🐟
          
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Ifremer's Genome Catalog platform provides access to the omics resources 🧬 of model marine organisms studied at Ifremer. \
          Genomes Catalog is an interactive web application that organizes entries through their metadata (taxonomy, assembly quality) and 
          give access to a Genome Browser [JBrowse2](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/) to visualise the omics data of each species. \
          The new data addition is automated thanks to the [omics-catalog workflow](https://github.com/ifremer-bioinformatics/omics-catalog). \
          My work was the enhence the original pipeline with new features (adding multiple tracks, data management, verification steps). 
          In addition to the public catalog, I have set up a private instance for viewing unpublished data on which teams are collaborating.
